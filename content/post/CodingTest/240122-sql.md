# Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

[문제 Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/managers-with-at-least-5-direct-reports/description/)

## 문제 설명

Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+---------+
| id | int |
| name | varchar |
| department | varchar |
| managerId | int |
+-------------+---------+

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.

Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

## 풀이 코드

```sql
select I.name
from(
select managerId, count(managerId) as counts
    from Employee
    where managerId is not null
    group by managerId
) as M
    join Employee as I on M.managerId = I.id
    where M.counts>=5;

# Confirmation Rate

[문제 Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/confirmation-rate/description/)

## 문제 설명

Table: Signups

+----------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id | int |
| time_stamp | datetime |
+----------------+----------+
user_id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row contains information about the signup time for the user with ID user_id.

Table: Confirmations

+----------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id | int |
| time_stamp | datetime |
| action | ENUM |
+----------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
user_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Signups table.
action is an ENUM (category) of the type ('confirmed', 'timeout')
Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either confirmed ('confirmed') or expired without confirming ('timeout').

The confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is 0. Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places.

Write a solution to find the confirmation rate of each user.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

## 풀이 코드

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select S.user_id, IFNull(C.confirmation_rate, 0) as confirmation_rate
from(
select user_id,
    round(count(if(action='confirmed', action, null)) / count(*), 2) as confirmation_rate
    from Confirmations
    group by user_id
) as C
right join Signups as S on C.user_id = S.user_id
```

# Monthly Transactions I

[문제 Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/monthly-transactions-i/description/)

## 문제 설명

Table: Transactions

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type |
+---------------+---------+
| id | int |
| country | varchar |
| state | enum |
| amount | int |
| trans_date | date |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about incoming transactions.
The state column is an enum of type ["approved", "declined"].

Write an SQL query to find for each month and country, the number of transactions and their total amount, the number of approved transactions and their total amount.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

## 풀이 코드

```sql
select
    date_format(trans_date, '%Y-%m') as month,
    country,
    count(*) as trans_count,
    count(if(state = 'approved', 1, null)) as approved_count,
    sum(amount) as trans_total_amount,
    sum(if(state = 'approved', amount, 0)) as approved_total_amount
from Transactions
group by country, month

# Immediate Food Delivery II

[문제 Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/immediate-food-delivery-ii/description/)

## 문제 설명

Table: Delivery

+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id | int |
| customer_id | int |
| order_date | date |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The result format is in the following example.

![](image-3.png)

## 풀이 코드

```sql
select
    round(100 * count(if(order_date=customer_pref_delivery_date, 1, null)) / count(*), 2) as immediate_percentage
from Delivery
where (customer_id, order_date) in (
    select customer_id, min(order_date)
    from Delivery
    group by customer_id
)
```
